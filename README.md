For our Columbia Engineering Undergraduate Senior Seminar Presentation, we modeled regressions for Twitter trends - specifically, hourly hashtag mentions for three events in 2009. 

We used the listed awk commands to filter out specific hashtag mentions from the dataset. spikePlot.m plots the hashtag mentions for each of these events. spikeFilter.m creates and graphs the simple linear and trinomial linear regressions for each event. 

Selected events were: Michael Jackson's death, Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swift at the 2009 VMAs, also known as the "Ima let you finish" incident, and the balloon boy incident. 

Raw data was pulled from Infochimps.
